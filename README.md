# GameGoogleTranslate

This is a collection of tools I have written to assist in making google translate mods for games. Execute the compiled programs to get usage info.

Currently supported games:

1. Minecraft
2. Hades (WIP)

### How to build
This project uses CMake. Simply execute the init script for your platform, or run the following commands:
```sh
mkdir -p build && cd build;
cmake ..
```
